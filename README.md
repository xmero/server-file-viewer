# Server File Viewer

This project consists of a server and an app.

The server's endpoints return the necesary means to properly visualize and download its file structure and files, which can be visualized through the app.

To run it, you need to:

1. Install and initialize the server by running `npm i` and `npm start` within the `server` folder.
2. Install and initialize the app by running `npm i` and `npm start` within the `app` folder.

## Usage

Use the app to navigate through the file tree of the server and preview and download any of its files.
